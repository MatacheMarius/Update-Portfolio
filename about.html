                            <p>My name is Marius Gabriel Matache and I was born in Bucharest, capital of Romania in 1992.
                                I'm 28 years old and I have lived in Seattle for 3 years now.
                                I was born in a poor familiy and my father died when I was 6 years old. But these things helped me to form a strong character and to have a different way of thinking about life.
                                From a fairly young age I started working and raising my own money so I could cover my expenses. Studying for me was a main goal.</P>
                                <p>I graduated University of law in Bucharest and after that I had the opportunity to come to USA.
                                It was a hard decision for me because I started again from 0, with only 700$ in my pocket, alone, with no family, no friends and 6000 mile away from my country.
                                I worked for a moving company for 3 years. I was able to save some money and I found an opportunity for me. Now I have decided to invest this money in my education as well.</P>
                                <p>I like to travel a lot and this is one of the reasons that pushed me to take this step.
                                In the US it's a matter of "TIME MEANS MONEY". But for me my time is more important than money.
                                And I learned that on my own.
                                </p>
